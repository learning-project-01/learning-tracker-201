- Java bytecode is like a special set of instructions that Java programs are converted into after being written. It’s not plain text like 
  the code you write, and it’s not the machine code that your computer understands directly. Instead, it’s something in between.

- When you write Java code and compile it (using javac), your code gets translated into bytecode, which is stored in a .class file.

- This bytecode can’t run on its own—it needs the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to read it and turn it into something your computer can execute.

### **Purpose of java bytecode**
- Platform Independence:
  Bytecode allows Java to maintain its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy. The same .class file can be executed on any platform that has 
  a JVM implementation.

- Abstraction from Hardware:
  Bytecode abstracts the underlying hardware, letting developers focus on application logic rather than hardware-specific implementation 
  details.

- Performance Optimization:
  Bytecode enables the JVM to apply Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, converting it into optimized machine code for the specific platform at 
  runtime.

- Dynamic Linking:
  The JVM can dynamically load and link bytecode at runtime, which is critical for modular and distributed systems.

 ### **Process flow** 

- Write Java Code: Source code written in .java files.
- Compile to Bytecode: Use javac to convert source code into bytecode stored in .class files.
- Run Bytecode on JVM: The JVM interprets the bytecode or compiles it to machine code for execution.
