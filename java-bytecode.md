- Java bytecode is like a special set of instructions that Java programs are converted into after being written. It’s not plain text like the 
  code you write, and it’s not the machine code that your computer understands directly. Instead, it’s something in between.

- When you write Java code and compile it (using javac), your code gets translated into bytecode, which is stored in a .class file.

- This bytecode can’t run on its own—it needs the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to read it and turn it into something your computer can execute.
